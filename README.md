# Third-Party-Entrainment-and-Learning

NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING UPDATED, AND WILL BE COMPLETED PENDING PUBLICATION OF THE FULL RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT.


This repository is a comprehensive record of the dynamical systems modelling research conducted during my Physics PhD at FAU as a Graduate Research Assistant from 2021 to 2024.

This research was conducted as part of research project in computational brain health funded by FAU's Stiles Nichelson Brain Institute through a Palm Health Fellowship investigating neurostimulation, as well an NIH/NIA-funded project investigating the preservation and loss of social engagement in groups of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) interacting younger unimpaired adult facilitator and control subjects

THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS DEVELOPED BY MY RESEARCH TEAM INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. We generalize the nonlinear dynamical system referred to as the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model of Coordination Dynamics to describe complex synchronization phenomena in higher-dimensional systems of coupled oscillators with arbitrary diversity (parameterized by each oscillator's natural frequency) and coupling (parameterized by each oscillator's coupling strengths) properties.
2. We extend these generalized HKB equations to model learning whereby transiently coupled systems can experience lasting adaptations in their intrinsic behavior as a result of their interactions.


THE FOLLOWING FILES ARE TO BE STORED IN THIS REPOSITORY:

1. MATLAB, Python, and Mathematica programs simulating the dynamics of the generalized HKB equations, with and without learning.
2. MATLAB, Python, and Mathematica programs which construct potential function landscapes to visualize the coordination dynamics of systems of three coupled oscillators, which are particularly useful for observing the effects of third-party stimulation on pairs of coupled oscillators.
3. Figures generated using MATLAB, Python, and Mathematica which illustrate the key qualitative findings of this research study.
