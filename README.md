# Third-Party-Entrainment-and-Learning

NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING UPDATED, AND WILL BE COMPLETED PENDING PUBLICATION OF THE FULL RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT.


This repository is a comprehensive record of the dynamical systems modelling research conducted during my Physics PhD at FAU as a Graduate Research Assistant from 2021 to 2024.

This research was conducted as part of research project in computational brain health funded by FAU's Stiles Nichelson Brain Institute through a Palm Health Fellowship investigating neurostimulation, as well an NIH/NIA-funded project investigating the preservation and loss of social engagement in groups of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) interacting younger unimpaired adult facilitator and control subjects

THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS DEVELOPED BY MY RESEARCH TEAM INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. We generalize the nonlinear dynamical system referred to as the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model of Coordination Dynamics to describe complex synchronization phenomena in higher-dimensional systems of coupled oscillators with arbitrary diversity (parameterized by each oscillator's natural frequency) and coupling (parameterized by each oscillator's coupling strengths) properties.
2. We generalize the hybrid Rayleigh-van-der-Pol system of coupled oscillators to arbitrary number of oscillators and arbitrary diversity and coupling parameters, which provides a higher-level description of the generalizd HKB equations.
3. We extend these generalized HKB equations to model learning whereby transiently coupled systems can experience lasting adaptations in their intrinsic behavior as a result of their interactions.


THE FOLLOWING FILES ARE TO BE STORED IN THIS REPOSITORY:

1. MATLAB, Python, and Mathematica programs simulating the dynamics of the generalized HKB equations, with and without learning.
2. MATLAB, Python, and Mathematica programs which construct potential function landscapes to visualize the coordination dynamics of systems of three coupled oscillators, which are particularly useful for observing the effects of third-party stimulation on pairs of coupled oscillators.
3. Figures generated using MATLAB, Python, and Mathematica which illustrate the key qualitative findings of this research study.


KEY FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT:

1. Nonlinear coupling to a third-party oscillator can allow a monostable pair of oscillators to coordinate bistably, inducing new patterns of coordination between the original pair.  This can also be generalized to networks of coupled oscillators.  We call this third-party induced multistability.
2. Monostability, multistability, and metastability can be induced in pairs of nonidentical oscillators by introducing a third-party oscillator having an intermediate natural frequency between the two.  We call this third-party pacing.
3. Asymmetric coupling phenomena (to be added later).
4. Learning phenomena (to be added later).
